TODO)

1. Implement "bool is_embedding(partial_embedding, data)" => Hard

2. Implement time_out function => thread  => Easy

3. Optimize the reference
=> unique_ptr can be used for memory optimization

4. Now, finding extendable vertices and constructing cmu is simultaneously handled.
=> for sake of efficiency
=> trade-off

5. Issues
Find Extendable vertice time complexity
Find Sorting criteria


6. Write in text not console => Easy
